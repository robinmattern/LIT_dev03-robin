      <td><font size="3" face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The US Mint began putting notches
        on the edges of coins containing gold and silver to discourage holders
        from shaving off small quantities of the precious metals. Dimes,
        quarters and half dollars are notched because they used
        to contain silver. Pennies and nickels aren't notched because the
        metals they contain are not valuable enough to shave.</font></td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><font size="3" face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When buttons were invented, they
        were very expensive and worn primarily by the rich. Because wealthy
        women were dressed by maids, dressmakers put the buttons on the maid's
        right. Since most people are right-handed, it is easier to push
        buttons on the right through holes on the left. And that's where
        women's buttons have remained since.</font></td>

    <tr>
      <td><font size="3" face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Middle Ages, when many
        people were unable to read or write, documents were often signed using
        an X. Kissing the X represented an oath to fulfill obligations
        specified in the document. The X and the kiss eventually became
        synonymous.</font></td>

        customary to pass an item, called a buck, from player to player to
        indicate whose turn it was to deal. If a player did not wish to assume
        the responsibility, he would &quot;pass the buck&quot; to the next

      <td><font size="3" face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It used to be common for someone
        to try to kill an enemy by offering him a poisoned drink. To prove to
        a guest that a drink was safe, it became customary for a guest to pour
        a small amount of his drink into the glass of the host. Both men would
        drink it simultaneously. When a guest trusted his host, he would then
        touch - or clink - the host's glass with his own.</font></td>

      <td><font size="3" face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Invented in 1825, limelight was
        used in lighthouses and stage lighting by burning a cylinder of lime
        which produced a brilliant light. In the theater, performers on stage
        &quot;in the limelight&quot; were seen by the audience to be the

        Europe were made of a dense, orange clay called pygg. When people
        saved coins in jars made of this clay, the jars became know as &quot;pygg
        banks.&quot; When an English potter misunderstood the word, he made a
        bank that resembled a pig. And it caught on.</font></td>

        went to France as a young girl (for education &amp; survival) Louis,
        King of France, learned that she loved the Scot game golf. So he had
        the first golf course outside of Scotland built for her enjoyment. To
        make sure she was properly chaperoned (and guarded) while she played
        Louis ordered cadets from a military school to accompany her. Mary
        liked this a lot and when she returned to Scotland (not a very good
        idea in the long run) she took the practice with her. In French the
        word cadet is pronounced 'ca-day' &amp; the Scots bastardized it into
        caddie.</font></td>
